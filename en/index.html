  <h2>About the Laboratory</h2>

  <p>
    The Soft Matter Physics Laboratory at Yamaguchi University is dedicated to
    elucidating the physical mechanisms underlying collective and nonequilibrium
    behaviors in soft matter systems such as colloidal dispersions, polymers,
    and liquids, based on concepts of statistical physics and condensed matter physics.
  </p>

  <p>
    Our research particularly focuses on molecular-scale electronic states,
    local structures, and dynamics in liquids and solutions.
    We promote an integrated research approach combining advanced spectroscopic
    experiments, theoretical analysis, and numerical simulations.
  </p>

  <p>
    By employing state-of-the-art soft X-ray emission spectroscopy,
    we experimentally investigate electronic structures and intermolecular
    interactions of molecules in liquid environments that are difficult to access
    by conventional techniques.
    Through these studies, we aim to uncover universal physical principles governing
    collective motion, phase separation, and nonequilibrium processes in soft matter.
  </p>

  <p>
    Through fundamental research, our laboratory seeks to provide a theoretical
    foundation for physical chemistry, interface science, and materials science,
    while also contributing to the development and standardization of new experimental
    methodologies.
  </p>

  <h2>Research Topics</h2>

  <h3>Development of Soft X-ray Spectroscopy for Electronic Structure Analysis</h3>
  <p>
    We develop experimental and analytical techniques based on soft X-ray emission
    and absorption spectroscopy (XES/XAS) to probe electronic states of atoms and
    molecules in liquids and solutions with high energy resolution.
  </p>

  <p>
    Soft X-ray spectroscopy provides elemental selectivity and local sensitivity,
    enabling direct evaluation of local electronic structures and chemical bonding
    that are difficult to access by optical spectroscopy or neutron scattering.
  </p>

  <p>
    To overcome experimental challenges specific to liquid samples,
    we optimize measurement conditions and data analysis methods,
    thereby expanding the applicability of soft X-ray spectroscopy to liquid-phase systems.
  </p>

  <h3>Applications to Molecular Liquids and Solution Chemistry</h3>
  <p>
    Using the developed spectroscopic techniques, we investigate electronic states,
    hydrogen-bond networks, and solvation structures of solute molecules in aqueous
    and organic solvents.
  </p>

  <p>
    Current research topics include electronic structure analysis of ionic liquids
    and solvated ionic liquids, as well as solvent-dependent electronic structure
    variations in organic and carboxylic acid molecules.
  </p>

  <p>
    These studies aim to establish an electronic-level understanding of how
    intermolecular interactions govern reactivity, thermodynamic stability,
    and dynamic behavior of molecular systems.
  </p>

  <h3>Extension to Interfaces and Electrochemical Reactions</h3>
  <p>
    We are extending soft X-ray spectroscopy to investigate material interfaces
    and interfacial reactions, particularly at electrode/solution interfaces.
  </p>

  <p>
    By developing in situ observation techniques for electronic states during
    electrochemical reactions, we aim to achieve molecular-level understanding of
    reaction fields that have traditionally been treated as black boxes.
    These studies are expected to contribute to research on secondary batteries,
    catalysis, and functional interface materials.
  </p>

  <h3>Related Studies on Polymer Structure Formation</h3>
  <p>
    As part of externally funded projects, we also study nanoscale hierarchical
    structure formation in polymer systems, such as bottlebrush polymers.
  </p>

  <p>
    By integrating electronic-state information with structural analysis,
    we aim to deepen the understanding of self-organization mechanisms in
    polymeric soft matter systems and explore new applications of soft X-ray spectroscopy.

  <h2>Conceptual Framework</h2>

  <p>
    Our research is centered on the advancement of electronic-state measurement
    and analysis based on soft X-ray spectroscopy and its application to liquids,
    solutions, and interfacial systems.
  </p>

  <p>
    By applying advanced spectroscopic techniques to systems that are difficult
    to access experimentally, we aim to clarify the essential mechanisms of
    intermolecular interactions, hydrogen bonding, and solvation structures.
  </p>

  <p>
    Through these efforts, we seek to strengthen the theoretical foundation of
    nonequilibrium soft matter physics and interfacial science,
    promoting integrated research across experiments, theory, and computation.
